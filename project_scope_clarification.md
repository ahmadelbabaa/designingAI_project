# HPC Prediction Analysis Project Scope Clarification

## Project Evolution and Changes

### Original vs. Current Scope
The project was initially conceived as a comprehensive analysis of High-Power Charging (HPC) stations with multiple components including geospatial analysis using TomTom API. However, the scope has evolved:

1. **TomTom API Integration Removed**: We are no longer using the TomTom API for origin/destination data. The `competitor_geospatial.py` file has been deleted as this component is no longer part of the project.

2. **Focus on Data-Driven Analysis**: Instead of relying on external APIs, we've shifted to using our existing datasets for all analysis, making the project more self-contained and reproducible.

3. **Dashboard-Centric Approach**: The project now focuses on creating an integrated dashboard that presents multiple analyses in one cohesive interface rather than separate standalone tools.

## Current Project Structure

### Core Components
1. **Data Processing Pipeline**: 
   - `HPC_integration_part1.py` - Initial data loading and preparation
   - `HPC_integration_part2.py` - Intermediate data processing
   - `HPC_integration_part3.py` - Final data integration

2. **Analysis Modules**:
   - `conversion_advisor.py` - Gas station to EV charging conversion analysis
   - `time_series_forecasting.py` - Usage prediction over time
   - New: `ev_charging_analysis.py` - EV charging patterns analysis

3. **Dashboard Interface**:
   - `enhanced_dashboard.py` - Flask application serving the integrated dashboard
   - HTML templates in the `templates/` directory
   - Static assets in `static/` directory

### Key Datasets
1. **Primary Datasets**:
   - `ev_charging_patterns.csv` - Core dataset for charging behavior analysis
   - `station_data_dataverse.csv` - Station-specific information
   - `hpc_usage_master.csv` - Integrated dataset from multiple sources

2. **Supplementary Datasets**:
   - `EVChargingStationUsage.csv` - California charging data (used for enrichment)
   - Various sampled datasets (with "_sample" suffix) - Used for development and testing

3. **Generated Output**:
   - Visualizations stored in `output/` directory
   - Data cache files in `data/processed/`

## Technical Architecture

1. **Data Flow**:
   - Raw data → Processing scripts → Integrated datasets → Analysis modules → Visualizations → Dashboard

2. **Serving Layers**:
   - Flask application (port 8080) - Main dashboard interface
   - Static file server (port 8000) - Serves large static assets separately for performance

3. **Analysis Pipeline**:
   - Data cleaning and normalization
   - Feature engineering
   - Statistical analysis and visualization
   - Integration into web interface

## Implementation Notes

1. **Environment Requirements**:
   - macOS environment
   - Python 3 (use `python3` command explicitly, not `python`)
   - Dependencies managed through requirements.txt

2. **Running the Application**:
   - Main entry point: `python3 enhanced_dashboard.py`
   - Individual analysis components can be run standalone for testing

3. **Development Workflow**:
   - Analysis scripts should generate outputs to the `output/` directory
   - Flask routes should be added to `enhanced_dashboard.py`
   - Templates should follow the established pattern in `templates/`

## Areas Requiring Attention

1. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Large datasets (especially the 81MB `EVChargingStationUsage.csv`) may cause memory issues
   - Consider implementing sampling or chunking for large file processing

2. **Integration Testing**:
   - Verify that each component works correctly when integrated into the dashboard
   - Check for consistency in data format between components

3. **Documentation**:
   - All new components should be thoroughly documented
   - Comments should explain the "why" not just the "what"
