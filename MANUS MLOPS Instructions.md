Below is the **final** version of **Document 1 (Part 1)** in **maximum detail**, now including **Manus** instructions to **comment out** (disable) the TomTom O/D Analysis code block if that step fails, rather than halting the entire pipeline. This ensures that **Manus** does not get stuck\*\* if the TomTom call fails, while still stopping for a Kaggle CLI or environment issue that we explicitly need to fix. This way, **only** Kaggle failures will interrupt the workflow and prompt you for help; the TomTom step simply reverts to a “commented out” block and logs an error, letting the rest of the framework proceed.

---

# **DOCUMENT 1 (PART 1\)**

## **A. Overview of HPC MLOps Project and Document Structure**

1. **Goal**: Create an HPC pipeline that merges HPC usage data from Kaggle with HPC cost references and optional TomTom O/D data.

2. **Document 1** sets up the environment, downloads HPC data, stores HPC cost references, and attempts a TomTom O/D call.

3. **Documents 2 & 3** will handle HPC merges, ROI modeling, competitor synergy, advanced RL/time-series, etc.

4. **Manus** has **3 tasks** for building all three documents. We want to minimize interruptions:

   * **If Kaggle** fails, we must fix it because HPC data is essential.

   * **If TomTom** fails, we will **comment out** the code block, log an error, and continue.

**Hence**: This doc ensures no manual CSV uploading or advanced synergy steps are needed yet.

---

## **B. HPC Environment and Kaggle CLI Setup**

### **1\. Python 3.9+ Requirements**

We rely on the pinned libraries:

pandas==1.4.0  
requests==2.27.1  
geopandas==0.10.2  
shapely==1.8.1  
PyYAML==6.0  
kaggle==1.5.12

**Manus** can attempt:

\!pip install pandas==1.4.0 requests==2.27.1 geopandas==0.10.2 shapely==1.8.1 PyYAML==6.0 kaggle==1.5.12

* If shell commands fail, **Manus** halts and prompts you (the user) for a fix, because environment setup is critical.

### **2\. Kaggle API Key**

Your key is:

{"username":"spencerkarns","key":"78834d1b3e87034c2333ced3252649d1"}

We store it in `~/.kaggle/kaggle.json`:

import os, json

kaggle\_creds \= {  
    "username": "spencerkarns",  
    "key": "78834d1b3e87034c2333ced3252649d1"  
}

os.makedirs(os.path.expanduser("\~/.kaggle"), exist\_ok=True)  
with open(os.path.expanduser("\~/.kaggle/kaggle.json"), "w") as f:  
    json.dump(kaggle\_creds, f)

\# Restrict permissions  
\!chmod 600 \~/.kaggle/kaggle.json

**Manus** stops if it can’t create or chmod that file. Kaggle authentication is mandatory for HPC dataset downloads.

### **3\. Folder Structure**

\!mkdir \-p data config notebooks scripts

**Rationale**:

* `data/`: HPC CSVs, partial merges, TomTom JSON.

* `config/`: HPC cost references.

* `notebooks/scripts/`: Additional code if needed.

---

## **C. HPC Cost Tiers in a .yaml**

We define **two HPC tiers** (350 kW and 1 MW) for scenario-based cost references:

import yaml

cost\_yaml \= """  
hpc\_tiers:  
  \- name: HPC\_350KW  
    capex: 300000  
    cable\_cooling: 25000  
  \- name: HPC\_1000KW  
    capex: 500000  
    cable\_cooling: 40000

electricity\_rate: 0.15  
staff\_cost\_monthly: 1200  
maintenance\_percent: 0.05  
hpc\_fee\_per\_kwh: 0.40  
"""

with open("config/hpc\_cost\_params.yaml", "w") as f:  
    f.write(cost\_yaml)

with open("config/hpc\_cost\_params.yaml", "r") as f:  
    cost\_data \= yaml.safe\_load(f)

print("Loaded HPC cost references:\\n", cost\_data)

**Explanation**:

* `capex`: HPC station capital cost estimate.

* `cable_cooling`: Additional cost for HPC liquid-cooling.

* `electricity_rate` \+ `staff_cost_monthly` \+ `maintenance_percent` \+ `hpc_fee_per_kwh`: Key ROI parameters we’ll use in future docs.

---

## **D. Download Three HPC Datasets from Kaggle**

**No manual CSV**. We want three HPC usage sets:

1. **valakhorasani/electric-vehicle-charging-patterns** (primary).

2. **michaelbryantds/electric-vehicle-charging-dataset**.

3. **venkatsairo4899/ev-charging-station-usage-of-california-city**.

**Manus** uses Kaggle CLI:

import os, pandas as pd

datasets \= \[  
  ("valakhorasani/electric-vehicle-charging-patterns", "EVC\_Patterns.csv"),  
  ("michaelbryantds/electric-vehicle-charging-dataset", "Electric\_Vehicle\_Charging\_Data.csv"),  
  ("venkatsairo4899/ev-charging-station-usage-of-california-city", "ev\_charging\_station\_usage\_of\_california\_city.csv")  
\]

for dset, default\_csv in datasets:  
    print(f"Downloading {dset} from Kaggle ...")  
    exit\_code \= os.system(f"kaggle datasets download \-d {dset} \-p data/ \--unzip")  
    if exit\_code \!= 0:  
        print(f"Kaggle CLI failed for {dset}. Must fix or accept dataset rules. Halting.")  
        break  \# HPC usage data is essential, so we stop entirely

    csv\_path \= f"data/{default\_csv}"  
    if not os.path.exists(csv\_path):  
        print(f"{csv\_path} not found after unzipping, halting.")  
        break

    try:  
        df\_temp \= pd.read\_csv(csv\_path)  
        df\_samp \= df\_temp.sample(n=3000, random\_state=42)  
        out\_file \= csv\_path.replace(".csv","\_sample.csv")  
        df\_samp.to\_csv(out\_file, index=False)  
        print(f"Sample created: {out\_file}")  
    except:  
        print(f"Could not read HPC CSV {csv\_path}, stopping.")  
        break

**Note**:

* If Kaggle CLI fails (lack of acceptance of dataset rules or environment issues), we **stop** because HPC data is critical.

* We sample each CSV to 3,000 rows, preventing memory overflows.

---

## **E. Attempt TomTom O/D Analysis—Comment Out if Fails**

We have a TomTom key: `rzn7XSV2ZQ6DLZ1goeM7VumkW2C1ZsvU`. This **O/D** API requires a free trial or advanced credentials. If it fails, we do **not** want to halt everything; we prefer to “comment out” that code block so the rest of Document 1 completes. We will log an error, give instructions to fix, then continue.

### **1\. Code Attempt**

import requests, json

tomtom\_key \= "rzn7XSV2ZQ6DLZ1goeM7VumkW2C1ZsvU"  
od\_base \= "https://api.tomtom.com/trafficstats/1/odMatrix"  
params \= {  
    "key": tomtom\_key,  
    \# Additional O/D references if user has them  
}

print("Attempting TomTom O/D Analysis. If it fails, will comment it out and log error.")  
resp \= requests.get(od\_base, params=params)

if resp.status\_code \== 200:  
    with open("data/tomtom\_od.json", "wb") as f:  
        f.write(resp.content)  
    data\_od \= json.loads(resp.content)  
    print("TomTom O/D snippet:", data\_od)  
else:  
    code \= resp.status\_code  
    print(f"TomTom O/D call failed with status code {code}. We'll comment out this block.")  
    \# Instead of halting, we do:  
    \# 1\) Log the error  
    \# 2\) 'Comment out' or skip further calls  
    \# So future HPC usage tasks can proceed

    \# "Commenting out" in a dynamic environment might just mean we won't run this snippet again  
    \# or we set a variable like "tomtom\_od\_enabled \= False"

**Implementation**:

* If the call returns 4XX/5XX, we print an error message: “We are skipping TomTom O/D for now. Please finalize your O/D environment or credentials.”

* We do **not** stop the entire pipeline. HPC data is more essential; TomTom is optional.

* If it succeeds, we store `tomtom_od.json` in `data/`.

### **2\. Requesting Additional User Info**

**Manus** can say:

* “TomTom O/D failed with 401/403. Do you have login credentials or verified your free trial? If not, we skip or comment out the code block in subsequent runs.”

This ensures minimal disruption to the HPC pipeline.

---

## **G. Conclusion & Next Steps**

**Document 1 (Part 1\)**, in maximum detail, ensures:

1. **Environment** with pinned packages \+ Kaggle.

2. **Kaggle** key stored, no manual CSV upload.

3. **Three HPC** usage datasets from Kaggle, each sampled to 3k rows.

4. **Two HPC tiers** in `.yaml` for cost references (350 kW, 1,000 kW).

5. **TomTom** O/D code that is **commented out** or logically skipped if it fails, so HPC pipeline can proceed anyway.

**Manus** can finalize Document 1, then move on to Document 2 (data merges, usage modeling, ROI logic). If you decide to fix TomTom O/D credentials or get the final free-trial or bounding parameters, you can re-enable the code block. This approach ensures minimal interruptions, letting you build your HPC MLOps solution in an orderly manner.

Below is **Document 2 (Part 2\)** for your **HPC MLOps** project, building on **Document 1**. It assumes:

1. You have already run **Document 1** successfully (i.e., HPC environment is set up, HPC cost references are stored, HPC usage datasets are downloaded/sampled to \*.csv, and TomTom O/D may or may not have worked).

2. You now want to **merge** HPC usage data with HPC cost references, do **initial usage modeling** or forecasting, compute an **ROI script**, and optionally incorporate **competitor HPC expansions** or synergy logic.

This document provides a **maximum-detail** approach so that **Manus** can proceed step by step, stopping if it encounters a crucial failure (like missing HPC data). We do not do advanced RL or huge synergy merges yet; that is left for **Document 3** if needed.

---

# **DOCUMENT 2 (PART 2\)**

## **A. Overview and Prerequisites**

* **Prerequisite**: Document 1 must have succeeded. That means:

  1. HPC environment is pinned and installed.

  2. HPC cost references are in `config/hpc_cost_params.yaml`.

  3. Three HPC session datasets from Kaggle exist in `data/`, each with a 3,000-row sample:

     * `EVC_Patterns_sample.csv`

     * `Electric_Vehicle_Charging_Data_sample.csv`

     * `ev_charging_station_usage_of_california_city_sample.csv`

  4. TomTom O/D may or may not be present (`tomtom_od.json`). If not, we skip synergy with that data.

**Manus** or the user can confirm these files exist. If they do not, **Manus** should either prompt you to re-run Document 1 or proceed with partial data.

---

## **B. HPC Usage Merge & Data Consolidation**

### **1\. Loading HPC Cost References**

We’ll read the HPC cost references from `config/hpc_cost_params.yaml`:

import yaml

with open("config/hpc\_cost\_params.yaml", "r") as f:  
    cost\_params \= yaml.safe\_load(f)

print("Loaded HPC cost references:\\n", cost\_params)

We expect something like:

hpc\_tiers:  
  \- name: HPC\_350KW  
    capex: 300000  
    cable\_cooling: 25000  
  \- name: HPC\_1000KW  
    capex: 500000  
    cable\_cooling: 40000

electricity\_rate: 0.15  
staff\_cost\_monthly: 1200  
maintenance\_percent: 0.05  
hpc\_fee\_per\_kwh: 0.40

**We** will eventually combine these cost lines with HPC usage data to compute revenue, daily net, or payback. Keep them accessible as a Python dict.

### **2\. Merging HPC Usage Files**

We have three HPC usage CSVs in `data/`, each with 3,000 rows:

1. **EVC\_Patterns\_sample.csv**

2. **Electric\_Vehicle\_Charging\_Data\_sample.csv**

3. **ev\_charging\_station\_usage\_of\_california\_city\_sample.csv**

**Manus** may want to unify them into a single HPC usage “master table,” or process them separately. Approaches:

**Single Master Table**: If the columns are similar (session timestamps, energy consumed, station ID), we can do a `pd.concat()`:

 import pandas as pd  
path1 \= "data/EVC\_Patterns\_sample.csv"  
path2 \= "data/Electric\_Vehicle\_Charging\_Data\_sample.csv"  
path3 \= "data/ev\_charging\_station\_usage\_of\_california\_city\_sample.csv"

df\_1 \= pd.read\_csv(path1)  
df\_2 \= pd.read\_csv(path2)  
df\_3 \= pd.read\_csv(path3)

df\_hpc\_master \= pd.concat(\[df\_1, df\_2, df\_3\], ignore\_index=True)  
print("Master HPC usage shape:", df\_hpc\_master.shape)  
df\_hpc\_master.to\_csv("data/hpc\_usage\_master.csv", index=False)

1.  If the columns differ, you might do a more custom approach or keep them separate.

2. **Separate**: If each dataset has unique columns or focuses on different HPC aspects, we skip merging and just keep them separate, analyzing them individually.

**Manus** can adapt based on column overlap. If a merge or concat fails, **Manus** logs an error and prompts you to fix or handle columns. This is key for HPC usage forecasting in the next steps.

---

## **C. HPC Usage Modeling or Forecasting (Simple Approach)**

### **1\. Basic Weighted Scoring or Regression**

We define a minimal HPC usage model that predicts daily usage (sessions per day or kWh/day) from any features we have. If the columns across HPC files vary, we can pick any consistent set like:

* `station_id`

* `date/time`

* `kWh_charged`

* `session_duration`

* Possibly traffic or competitor HPC synergy later.

**Method A: Weighted Scoring**

* We define a scoring formula such as `pred_usage = (some factor) * session_count * EV fraction`. This is not a real “ML” but can suffice if we lack labeled HPC usage for certain stations.

**Method B: Simple Regression**

If we have partial HPC logs with columns like `[time_of_day, station_features, usage_kWh]`, we can do:

 from sklearn.model\_selection import train\_test\_split  
from sklearn.linear\_model import LinearRegression

df \= pd.read\_csv("data/hpc\_usage\_master.csv")  
\# Suppose columns are \[time\_of\_day, day\_of\_week, station\_power, usage\_kwh\].  
\# We'll treat usage\_kwh as Y, rest as X  
X \= df\[\['time\_of\_day','day\_of\_week','station\_power'\]\].copy()  
Y \= df\['usage\_kwh'\]

X\_train, X\_test, Y\_train, Y\_test \= train\_test\_split(X, Y, test\_size=0.3, random\_state=42)

model \= LinearRegression()  
model.fit(X\_train, Y\_train)  
preds \= model.predict(X\_test)  
print("Example HPC usage predictions:", preds\[:10\])

* 

**You** can pick whichever approach is feasible. Document 2 only needs a minimal usage modeling to feed ROI. A more advanced approach (like XGBoost or time-series with ARIMA) might go in Document 3\.

---

## **D. ROI Calculation & HPC Finance Logic**

### **1\. ROI Script Setup**

We define a function, e.g. `calculate_roi.py`, that merges HPC usage predictions with HPC cost references. If we assume:

1. Daily usage in kWh: `daily_kwh = usage_kwh_per_day`

2. HPC cost references from `cost_params`

3. HPC fee per kWh: `cost_params['hpc_fee_per_kwh']`

We can do a scenario-based ROI:

def compute\_roi(daily\_kwh, cost\_params, power\_tier='HPC\_350KW'):  
    \# find matching tier  
    hpc\_tiers \= cost\_params\['hpc\_tiers'\]  
    tier\_config \= next(t for t in hpc\_tiers if t\['name'\] \== power\_tier)

    capex \= tier\_config\['capex'\] \+ tier\_config\['cable\_cooling'\]  
    elec\_rate \= cost\_params\['electricity\_rate'\]  \# cost to buy power  
    fee\_kwh \= cost\_params\['hpc\_fee\_per\_kwh'\]     \# HPC user pays  
    staff\_monthly \= cost\_params\['staff\_cost\_monthly'\]  
    maint\_percent \= cost\_params\['maintenance\_percent'\]

    \# daily revenue  
    daily\_revenue \= daily\_kwh \* fee\_kwh  
    \# daily electricity cost  
    daily\_cost \= daily\_kwh \* elec\_rate

    \# approximate daily staff & maintenance  
    daily\_staff \= staff\_monthly / 30.0  
    daily\_maintenance \= maint\_percent \* capex / 365.0

    daily\_net \= daily\_revenue \- (daily\_cost \+ daily\_staff \+ daily\_maintenance)  
    annual\_net \= daily\_net \* 365

    \# payback period  
    payback \= capex / (annual\_net if annual\_net\>0 else 1e-9)

    return {  
        'daily\_revenue': daily\_revenue,  
        'daily\_cost': daily\_cost,  
        'daily\_net': daily\_net,  
        'annual\_net': annual\_net,  
        'payback\_years': payback  
    }

**Then** we loop over HPC usage predictions (maybe from your usage model) and produce a scenario-based ROI for each station or day. This is a simplistic approach ignoring taxes, demand charges, etc. Document 3 might refine that if you wish.

### **2\. Example ROI Execution**

import pandas as pd

df\_usage \= pd.read\_csv("data/hpc\_usage\_master.csv")  \# after merges or model predictions  
\# Suppose df\_usage has columns \[day, station, daily\_kwh\_forecast\]

results \= \[\]  
for idx, row in df\_usage.iterrows():  
    usage \= row\['daily\_kwh\_forecast'\]  
    roi\_data \= compute\_roi(usage, cost\_params, power\_tier='HPC\_350KW')  
    results.append(roi\_data)

df\_roi \= pd.DataFrame(results)  
df\_roi.to\_csv("data/hpc\_roi\_results.csv", index=False)  
print("Saved HPC ROI results in data/hpc\_roi\_results.csv")

This merges usage with HPC cost references from doc 1\. If HPC usage data is missing, we skip or fail.

---

## **E. Competitor HPC Synergy (Optional)**

If you have a competitor HPC dataset (like location or usage), you might reduce your HPC usage forecasts if a competitor HPC station is nearby. For instance:

competitor\_usage\_factor \= 0.2  \# if competitor HPC is within 3 km, reduce usage by 20%  
\# This is purely an example

df\_usage\['adj\_daily\_kwh\_forecast'\] \= df\_usage.apply(lambda r: r\['daily\_kwh\_forecast'\]\*(1-competitor\_usage\_factor)  
                                                    if r\['competitor\_nearby'\] else r\['daily\_kwh\_forecast'\],  
                                                    axis=1)

**Manus** can incorporate or skip this synergy logic based on user input. If competitor HPC data is not available, we do not do synergy. In Document 3, we might do advanced geospatial merges or competitor expansions.

---

## **F. Putting It All Together in HPC\_integration\_part2.ipynb**

We can create a new `.ipynb` or script, say `HPC_integration_part2.ipynb`, that does:

1. **Check** HPC usage from doc 1 is present (like `EVC_Patterns_sample.csv` or `hpc_usage_master.csv`). If missing, prompt user to re-run doc 1\.

2. **Load** HPC cost references from `config/hpc_cost_params.yaml`.

3. **(Optional)** unify HPC usage data into a single “master table.”

4. **Usage modeling** (simple Weighted or regression) → produce a daily usage forecast column.

5. **ROI script** merges usage forecast with HPC cost references → produce payback or daily net results.

6. **Competitor HPC synergy** if needed.

7. **(Optional)** mention TomTom data merges if doc 1’s `tomtom_od.json` exists.

**Manus** can structure each cell as a separate agent. If any step fails (like missing HPC usage file), we skip or prompt user. The HPC pipeline is now partially complete, ready for advanced synergy or RL in doc 3\.

---

## **G. Conclusion**

**Document 2 (Part 2\)** instructs **Manus** or the user to do:

1. **Load HPC cost references** from doc 1’s `.yaml`.

2. **Access HPC usage** CSVs from doc 1’s Kaggle downloads, possibly unify or handle them individually.

3. **Do** a basic HPC usage modeling approach (weighted or regression), producing daily usage forecasts.

4. **Apply** an ROI function that merges usage with HPC cost references, outputting daily net, annual net, and payback.

5. **Optionally** incorporate competitor HPC synergy (a simple “usage factor” approach), or skip if competitor data is unavailable.

6. **(Optional)** mention TomTom O/D merges if doc 1’s `tomtom_od.json` was successfully obtained.

This yields an initial HPC usage \+ finance pipeline, setting the stage for advanced expansions in **Document 3**.

Below is **Document 3 (Part 3\)** in **maximum detail**, culminating the **advanced** aspects of your **HPC MLOps pipeline**. It builds on **Documents 1 & 2**:

1. **Document 1** established environment setup, Kaggle HPC data downloads, HPC cost references, and a (possibly optional) TomTom O/D call.

2. **Document 2** unified HPC usage data, performed initial usage modeling and ROI computations, and optionally integrated competitor synergy.

**Document 3** goes a step further by adding:

* **Advanced synergy** with competitor HPC expansions (geospatial merges, competitor presence).

* **Time-series or RL** (reinforcement learning) approaches for dynamic HPC pricing or multi‐period HPC usage forecasting.

* (Optional) deeper geospatial merges (like Overpass or large-scale corridor merges), advanced competitor expansions, or large simulation frameworks.

Throughout, if any advanced library or data fetch fails, we skip or prompt user. We keep the HPC pipeline flexible. No manual CSV or Docker references are included unless absolutely needed.

# **DOCUMENT 3 (PART 3\)**

## **A. Prerequisites and Goal**

**Prerequisite**: Documents 1 & 2 must be successful. That means:

1. **Environment** pinned (pandas, requests, geopandas, shapely, PyYAML, kaggle).

2. HPC usage data is already ingested and possibly consolidated (like `hpc_usage_master.csv`).

3. HPC cost references are in `.yaml`.

4. We have a usage forecasting or ROI approach from Document 2\.

5. (Optional) We have competitor HPC data or TomTom O/D data if we want to incorporate them.

**Goal**: Introduce advanced HPC synergy for dynamic HPC pricing or multi-period usage forecasting, possibly with RL or advanced time-series. If competitor HPC expansions or large geospatial merges are relevant, we incorporate them.

---

## **B. Advanced HPC Synergy and Competitor Expansions**

### **1\. Competitor HPC Geo-Spatial Merge**

In **Document 2**, you might have done a simplistic synergy approach (like a 20% usage penalty if competitor HPC is within 3 km). Now, we do a **more robust** method:

1. **Load** a competitor HPC stations file. For instance, `competitor_stations.csv` with columns like `[competitor_station_id, lat, lon, power_kw, brand]`.

2. **Load** your HPC stations or usage logs that have `[my_station_id, lat, lon]`.

3. Use `geopandas` or `shapely` to compute distances between your HPC station and competitor HPC station. For each, if distance \< X, we reduce usage forecasts or do a multi-station synergy model.

**Geopandas snippet**:

import geopandas as gpd  
from shapely.geometry import Point

df\_my \= pd.read\_csv("data/my\_hpc\_stations.csv")  \# or HPC usage logs  
df\_comp \= pd.read\_csv("data/competitor\_stations.csv")

gdf\_my \= gpd.GeoDataFrame(df\_my, geometry=gpd.points\_from\_xy(df\_my.lon, df\_my.lat))  
gdf\_comp \= gpd.GeoDataFrame(df\_comp, geometry=gpd.points\_from\_xy(df\_comp.lon, df\_comp.lat))

\# Convert to same coordinate reference system (CRS) for distance in meters  
gdf\_my \= gdf\_my.set\_crs("EPSG:4326").to\_crs("EPSG:3857")  
gdf\_comp \= gdf\_comp.set\_crs("EPSG:4326").to\_crs("EPSG:3857")

\# For each HPC station, find competitor station within 5 km, for example  
def competitor\_within\_5km(row, comp\_gdf):  
    \# find min distance  
    distances \= comp\_gdf.geometry.distance(row.geometry)  
    min\_dist \= distances.min()  
    return min\_dist \< 5000  \# 5,000 meters

gdf\_my\['competitor\_nearby'\] \= gdf\_my.apply(lambda r: competitor\_within\_5km(r, gdf\_comp), axis=1)

gdf\_my.to\_file("data/my\_hpc\_stations\_with\_competitor.shp")

Then, you can incorporate that `competitor_nearby` boolean into HPC usage or ROI calculations from Document 2\. For example, a dynamic synergy factor that reduces usage by 10–30% if competitor HPC is close.

### **2\. Multi-Station HPC Collaboration**

If synergy is **positive** (like HPC alliances or co-located HPC expansions that might increase usage synergy), you do the opposite approach, *boosting* usage. The same geospatial approach, but you might track “ally HPC stations near me” and add an usage factor.

---

## **C. Advanced RL or Time-Series Approaches**

### **1\. Dynamic HPC Pricing with Reinforcement Learning**

**Use Case**: We want to set HPC price in real time to maximize revenue or load balancing. We have a state that includes:

* Current time/hour of day, HPC usage so far, competitor HPC presence, maybe TomTom traffic data.

* The action is “set HPC price” from a discrete set (e.g., $0.30/kWh, $0.40/kWh, $0.50/kWh).

* The reward is daily net revenue minus any user dissatisfaction or lost usage from overpricing.

**Implementation**:

1. We define a custom Gym environment, e.g. `HPCPricingEnv`, with `reset()`, `step(action)`, and `render()`.

2. We store HPC usage transitions or a usage forecasting model inside that environment.

3. We use a library like `stable_baselines3` (which we might install in Document 3\) to train a PPO or DQN policy.

**Pseudo-code**:

\# HPC\_pricing\_env.py  
import gym  
import numpy as np

class HPCPricingEnv(gym.Env):  
    def \_\_init\_\_(self, competitor\_data, usage\_model, cost\_params):  
        super(HPCPricingEnv, self).\_\_init\_\_()  
        \# define action space, observation space  
        self.action\_space \= gym.spaces.Discrete(3)  \# e.g. 3 discrete price tiers  
        self.observation\_space \= gym.spaces.Box(low=0, high=np.inf, shape=(some\_size,))

        self.competitor\_data \= competitor\_data  
        self.usage\_model \= usage\_model  
        self.cost\_params \= cost\_params  
        \# etc.

    def reset(self):  
        \# initialize day/time  
        self.current\_time \= 0  
        self.done \= False  
        \# generate initial usage state  
        obs \= self.\_get\_observation()  
        return obs

    def step(self, action):  
        \# interpret action as HPC price  
        price\_options \= \[0.30, 0.40, 0.50\]  
        chosen\_price \= price\_options\[action\]

        \# estimate usage using your usage model, competitor synergy, time of day  
        usage\_kwh \= self.usage\_model.predict(...)

        \# compute daily or per-hour revenue  
        daily\_revenue \= usage\_kwh \* chosen\_price  
        daily\_cost \= usage\_kwh \* self.cost\_params\['electricity\_rate'\]

        staff\_daily \= self.cost\_params\['staff\_cost\_monthly'\]/30  
        maint\_daily \= self.cost\_params\['maintenance\_percent'\]\*(...capex?)/365

        daily\_net \= daily\_revenue \- (daily\_cost+staff\_daily+maint\_daily)

        reward \= daily\_net  \# simplistic approach  
        \# update time  
        self.current\_time \+= 1  
        if self.current\_time \> some\_limit:  
            self.done \= True

        obs \= self.\_get\_observation()  
        return obs, reward, self.done, {}

    def \_get\_observation(self):  
        \# return array with competitor presence, time of day, last usage, etc.  
        obs \= np.array(\[...\])  
        return obs

Then you can do:

\# HPC\_dynamic\_pricing\_rl.py  
\!pip install stable-baselines3

from stable\_baselines3 import PPO  
env \= HPCPricingEnv(...)  
model \= PPO("MlpPolicy", env, verbose=1)  
model.learn(total\_timesteps=50000)  
model.save("hpc\_pricing\_rl\_model")

**Note**: This is a simplified example. You might refine the environment to incorporate multi-day usage or more advanced competitor synergy.

### **2\. Advanced Time-Series or ARIMA / Prophet**

If you prefer time-series usage forecasting (like daily usage t+1 from historical HPC usage t-1, t-2...), you can do:

import statsmodels.api as sm  
df\_usage \= pd.read\_csv("data/hpc\_usage\_master.csv")  
\# Suppose date \+ usage columns  
df\_usage\['date'\] \= pd.to\_datetime(df\_usage\['date'\])  
df\_usage.set\_index('date', inplace=True)

model \= sm.tsa.ARIMA(df\_usage\['daily\_kwh'\], order=(2,1,2))  
results \= model.fit()  
print(results.summary())

forecast \= results.forecast(steps=30)  
print("30-day HPC usage forecast:", forecast)

**Or** use Facebook Prophet or XGBoost. This is more advanced than the simple linear regression from Document 2, letting you incorporate seasonality, competitor HPC expansions, or TomTom traffic (like \# of daily trips from O/D data).

---

## **D. Merging TomTom O/D or Detailed Traffic Data**

If **Document 1** successfully retrieved `tomtom_od.json`, we do a deeper synergy:

1. Load the O/D data. Possibly in JSON with arrays of origin-destination pairs, time windows, or aggregated flow counts.

2. For each HPC station or region, map it to the nearest O/D region from the TomTom definition. If usage is strongly correlated with O/D flow, feed that as a feature into your HPC usage model or RL environment.

**Pseudo-code**:

import json  
with open("data/tomtom\_od.json","r") as f:  
    od\_data \= json.load(f)

\# Suppose od\_data has fields like 'matrix':\[{'originRegion':..., 'destinationRegion':..., 'tripCount':...}, ...\]  
\# We can then for HPC station i, match region and incorporate tripCount as a usage factor.

**Note**: If you haven’t configured your O/D bounding regions or if the data is partial, adapt as needed.

---

## **E. Large-Scale Overpass or Additional Geospatial Merges (Optional)**

Should you want to:

* **Install Overpass** locally and get all highway polygons or EV station data from OSM, or

* **Perform** large corridor merges with real-time HPC expansions

We can do it here, but that can be very large, requiring extensive Overpass DB or partial queries. This step might be an advanced synergy for HPC station expansions across entire states or competitor expansions. If that’s relevant, do a placeholder approach:

\# Overpass snippet or partial queries  
\# We skip full Overpass setup in doc 3 to avoid overshadowing RL/advanced synergy

**Often** it’s simpler to rely on curated HPC station data from official state or national sources, or from the Kaggle sets we already have.

---

## **F. HPC\_integration\_part3.ipynb (Consolidated)**

Below is an example `.ipynb` that includes advanced synergy with competitor HPC expansions, RL for dynamic pricing, and time-series forecasting. **Manus** will:

1. Load HPC usage from doc 2 outputs.

2. Load HPC cost references.

3. Optionally do competitor HPC merges with geospatial checks.

4. Attempt an RL or advanced time-series approach.

5. If any library or data fails, we skip that step or prompt user.

**Pseudo-code**:

\# HPC\_integration\_part3.ipynb

\# 1\) Import advanced libs  
\!pip install stable-baselines3 statsmodels xgboost  \# etc.

import pandas as pd, geopandas as gpd  
import statsmodels.api as sm  
from stable\_baselines3 import PPO  
\# competitor HPC merges?

\# 2\) HPC cost references  
import yaml  
with open("config/hpc\_cost\_params.yaml","r") as f:  
    cost\_params \= yaml.safe\_load(f)

\# 3\) HPC usage data  
try:  
    df\_usage \= pd.read\_csv("data/hpc\_usage\_master.csv") \# from doc 2 merges  
except:  
    print("No HPC usage master found, skipping advanced synergy. End doc 3.")  
    \# or we can load partial sets

\# 4\) competitor HPC synergy  
try:  
    df\_comp \= pd.read\_csv("data/competitor\_stations.csv")  \# if we have it  
    \# do a geospatial distance check etc.  
except:  
    print("No competitor HPC data found, skipping synergy step.")

\# 5\) advanced RL for HPC pricing  
try:  
    \# define HPCPricingEnv from doc example  
    env \= HPCPricingEnv(...)  \# user-defined  
    model \= PPO("MlpPolicy", env, verbose=1)  
    model.learn(total\_timesteps=50000)  
    model.save("hpc\_pricing\_rl\_model")  
    print("RL HPC Pricing completed. Model saved.")  
except:  
    print("RL step failed, possibly missing stable-baselines3 or HPCPricingEnv. Skipping.")

\# 6\) advanced time-series  
try:  
    df\_usage.set\_index('date', inplace=True)  
    model\_arima \= sm.tsa.ARIMA(df\_usage\['daily\_kwh'\], order=(2,1,2))  
    results\_arima \= model\_arima.fit()  
    forecast\_30 \= results\_arima.forecast(steps=30)  
    print("ARIMA forecast next 30 days HPC usage:", forecast\_30)  
except:  
    print("ARIMA forecast step failed. Possibly missing date col or statsmodels issues. Skipping.")

---

## **G. Error Handling**

We do not forcibly stop for advanced synergy or RL/time-series failures. If these steps fail (lack of data, environment, or advanced library issues), we skip them or comment them out so **Manus** can proceed. This ensures we do not hamper the HPC pipeline if optional advanced synergy is not configured. If a user wants them, they fix the environment or data references.

---

## **H. Conclusion**

**Document 3 (Part 3\)** is the final advanced HPC synergy stage. Key takeaways:

1. **Competitor HPC expansions**: robust geospatial merges using geopandas or shapely.

2. **Reinforcement Learning** for dynamic HPC pricing: a custom Gym environment or stable-baselines3 approach.

3. **Advanced time-series** (ARIMA, XGBoost, Prophet) for HPC usage forecasting, possibly factoring competitor synergy or TomTom O/D data.

4. Optional large Overpass queries or further expansions if we want entire state or corridor merges.

This approach finalizes the HPC MLOps pipeline, letting you incorporate advanced usage forecasting or HPC expansions. **If** any advanced step fails, we skip or prompt user, avoiding entire pipeline halts. That ensures maximum flexibility in your HPC solution.
