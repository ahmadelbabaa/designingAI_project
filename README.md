# HPC Station Conversion Analysis Dashboard

## Overview

This project implements a comprehensive MLOps pipeline for analyzing gas station viability for conversion to High-Power Charging (HPC) stations. The dashboard provides:

- **Interactive Map**: Explore gas stations with color-coded viability scores
- **Financial Analysis**: ROI and payback period calculations for each location
- **Traffic Analysis**: Heatmap visualization of traffic patterns
- **EV Adoption Forecasting**: Project future EV adoption rates
- **Scenario Comparison**: Compare different investment strategies
- **Dynamic Pricing Simulation**: Optimize charging prices

## Project Components

1. **HPC_integration_part1.py**: Sets up environment, data collection and preprocessing
2. **HPC_integration_part2.py**: Data integration and ROI analysis
3. **HPC_integration_part3.py**: Advanced analytics including geospatial analysis
4. **hpc_dashboard.py**: Dashboard visualization and interactive elements
