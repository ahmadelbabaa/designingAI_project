## Phase 1: Data Preprocessing and Standardization - COMPLETED
1. **Create Standardized JSON Schemas for Datasets** - Done
   - Defined JSON schemas for charging station metadata, charging session data, and forecast data to ensure consistent data formats across the application.

2. **Implement Data Adapters for Standardization** - Done
   - Created adapter classes (StationAdapter, SessionAdapter, ForecastAdapter) to transform data from various sources into standardized format.
   - Implemented a DataLoader class to handle loading and transformation of data from files.

3. **Develop Data Loading and Preprocessing Module** - Done
   - Implemented a DataLoader class that can discover, transform, and load data from multiple file formats
   - Created a unified interface for registering datasets with the repository

4. **Implement Data Validation Utilities** - Done
   - Created a DataValidator class that validates data against JSON schemas
   - Implemented validation reporting with detailed error messages
   - Added CLI interface for validating datasets from the repository

5. **Create Data Visualization Module** - Done
   - Implemented the DataVisualizer class with methods for visualizing station, session, and forecast data
   - Created interactive maps for charging stations using Folium
   - Developed comprehensive session data visualizations (usage patterns, distributions, etc.)
   - Created forecast visualizations with confidence intervals
   - Built an integrated HTML dashboard that combines all visualizations

## Phase 2: Time Series Analysis and Forecasting Models
